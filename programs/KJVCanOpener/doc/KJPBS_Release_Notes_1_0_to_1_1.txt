Change Notes
1.0 to 1.1
----------------------------
- Fixed the Ctrl-Plus and Ctrl-Minus shortcut keys for zooming Scripture
	Browser and Details Popup
- Set the Detail Popup to remember its font size when the user Zooms it
	with Ctrl-Plus and/or Ctrl-Minus (or Control-MouseWheel) so that
	it stays set on future popups.
- Changed "Copy as Verses" to work with the current Scripture Browser
	cursor position when there is no selection.
- Moved the User Database (kjvuser.s3db) to the User's Application Data
	folder so that it can be updated and maintained consistently on all
	three platforms.  Changed the copy of kjvuser.s3db that ships with
	KJPBS to only be a template for building the initial User Database in
	their home folder.
- Complete Native Builds and Installers for Linux and Mac!
- Updated Documentation, porting to LibreOffice and dropped MS Office use
- New graphics and splash screen (Thanks Laura!)
- Shipping DejaVu fonts and using programmatic font loading on all
	platforms so the look-and-feel is consistent on all three.
- No longer registering shipped fonts with the Window System.  They
	are now loaded programmatically only.
- Added saving of the application window-control font to preserve
	look-and-feel when relaunching the app.
- Changed the command-line arguments flag from / to - due to our new
	Linux and Mac platforms.
- Fixed a bug in the Font dialogs that could cause it to hang on some
	platforms and switched to native font dialogs.  Qt seems to still have
	a bug where the Normal/Book/Regular font style doesn't properly select
- Fixed database memory leak issue with the query object.  It was minor
	since the database is only used at startup.
